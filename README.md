Introduction
-------------

PteroControl is a bot designed to make administrating servers running on Pterodactyl more convenient by allowing admins to quickly run certain tasks directly from Discord:

* Written in Javascript, CloudServer is faster and more stable.
* PteroControl can be used with any server on Pterodactyl, irregardless of whether it's on shared hosting or your own hosted panel

PteroControl is still **under development** and we welcome contributions.
